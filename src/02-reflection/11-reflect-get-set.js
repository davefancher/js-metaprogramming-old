// Reflect.get and Reflect.set do exactly what they say they do: get and set
// properties on an object.

const myObject = {
    firstName: "Dave",
    lastName: "Fancher"
};

Reflect.set(myObject, "firstName", "David"); //?
Reflect.get(myObject, "firstName"); //?

myObject; //?

// I don't find them all that useful for day-to-day tasks since I generally have
// reasonable knowledge about the objects I'm working with but in situations where
// objects are being more dynamically managed these functions can be useful in
// preventing setting properties on non-objects
